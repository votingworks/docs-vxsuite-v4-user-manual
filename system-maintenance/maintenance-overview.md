# Maintenance Overview

Voting system maintenance is an ongoing process that is a part of every election. The core maintenance procedures are already described in the user manual throughout, with procedures enumerated in the [setup-inspection.md](../logic-and-accuracy-pre-election-testing/setup-inspection.md "mention") and supplies enumerated in the [supply-list.md](../miscellaneous/supply-list.md "mention").

The following maintenance manuals take the perspective of long-term system maintenance and are targeted at a system administrator or maintenance technician. In addition to referencing the regular election maintenance tasks, it specifies some long-term maintenance tasks, points to manufacturer documentation, and makes recommendations for spares and service. The [approved-parts-list.md](approved-parts-list.md "mention") is a more formal and complete extension of the [supply-list.md](../miscellaneous/supply-list.md "mention").
