# Maintenance Overview

Voting system maintenance is an ongoing process that is a part of every election. General maintenance procedures are described in [setup-inspection.md](../logic-and-accuracy-pre-election-testing/setup-inspection.md "mention") and supplies in the [supply-list.md](../miscellaneous/supply-list.md "mention").

The following maintenance manuals are provided for long-term system maintenance reference and are targeted at a system administrator whose role and training requirements are defined in [programming-cards.md](../vxadmin-system-setup/programming-cards.md "mention"). Maintenance tasks that need to be performed by a VotingWorks technician are specifically identified in each voting system component maintenance manual.

In addition to regular election maintenance tasks, they include additional long-term maintenance tasks, provide manufacturer documentation, and make recommendations for spare parts and service. The [approved-parts-list.md](approved-parts-list.md "mention") is a more formal and complete extension of the [supply-list.md](../miscellaneous/supply-list.md "mention").
