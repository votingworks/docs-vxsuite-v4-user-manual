## Hardware Maintenance

The end user should never try to perform complex repairs on VxMark. Only VotingWorks is expected to perform repairs that require disassembly of any kind. End users are expected to keep the scanner, screen, and USB ports clean.

### Scanner Cleaning

The scanner should be cleaned for every election before pre-election testing and again after pre-election testing. For instructions, see the [#cleaning-vxmark](../vxmark/vxmark-hardware-setup.md#cleaning-vxmark "mention") section in the user manual. VotingWorks recommends using Ricoh Cleaner F1 (PN: PA03950-0352) with cleaning wipes (PN: CG90000-120001) or equivalent. Other scanner-specific cleaning fluids or greater than 70% isopropyl alcohol can be used for the cleaning fluid. A microfiber or lint-free cloth can be used for the wipe.

### Other Maintenance Tasks

VotingWorks recommends cleaning the screen and the USB port as needed. The screen can be cleaned by gently wiping with cleaning wipes such as ULINE S-12236 or equivalent. The USB port can be cleaned by blowing it with air in a can, such as ULINE S-6771 or equivalent, from a distance of at least one foot. Read all manufacturer safety instructions before using air in a can.

## Software Maintenance

There are no required steps for maintaining the software or firmware itself. The software is installed by VotingWorks and cannot be modified. The underlying databases for all applications are self-maintaining and do not need to be tuned by end users.

## Data Maintenance

VxMark does not store voter selections or tabulate ballots. There is no need to perform data backups.

## Maintenance Support & Spare Recommendations

VotingWorks recommends having scanner cleaning supplies immediately available at all times. If a dirty scanner prevents ballots from being interpreted and presented to users, voting cannot continue. In order to avoid delays in voting, scanning cleaning supplies should be at all voting locations.
