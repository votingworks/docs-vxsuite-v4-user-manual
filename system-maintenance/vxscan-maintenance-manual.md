For reference information on VxScan, see the following links:

## Hardware Maintenance

The end user should never try to perform complex repairs on VxScan. The top panel, behind which sits the screen and the speaker, is sealed. The bottom left panel, under which sits the computer and USB hub, is sealed. The bottom right panel, under which sits the power supplies, is sealed. None of these seals should be removed and none of these panels should be removed by end users. Only VotingWorks is expected to perform repairs that require removing panels. End users are expected to keep the scanner clean, keep the printer paper loaded, and keep the screen and USB ports clean.

### Scanner Cleaning

The scanner should be cleaned for every election before pre-election testing and again after pre-election testing. For instructions, see the / article in the user manual. VotingWorks recommends using Ricoh Cleaner F1 (PN: PA03950-0352) with cleaning wipes (PN: CG90000-120001) or equivalent. Other scanner-specific cleaning fluids or greater than 70% isopropyl alcohol can be used for the cleaning fluid. A microfiber or lint-free cloth can be used for the wipe.

If the software detects streaks in a scanned ballot, the user will be alerted and prompted to clean the scanner. To identify streaks proactively, an election manager or system administrator can perform a test scan in the diagnostics interface. For instructions, see the[vxscan-diagnostics.md](../vxscan/vxscan-diagnostics.md "mention") article.

### Printer Paper Management

VxScan features a full letter-width report printer. In order for VxScan to print reports, it must be properly loaded with a thermal paper roll. Polls cannot be opened or closed without the paper installed. The thermal paper rolls are provided by VotingWorks. While it is possible to use thermal rolls from another vendor as long as it meets the requirements specified in the [approved-parts-list.md](approved-parts-list.md "mention"), it is not recommend.&#x20;

The thermal paper rolls are 78' in length. The amount of paper used will depend on the number of reports printed and the number of contests appearing on the report. 78' is enough for an entire election, including pre-election testing, in almost all cases. VotingWorks recommends replacing the thermal paper roll once for each election. Customers may choose to re-use rolls between elections but, in doing so, greatly increase the risk of running out of paper in the middle of an election. In those situations, an unprepared poll worker may have to replace paper or wait for an election administrator.

Replacing the paper roll is generally performed by an election manager, but may also be performed by a system administrator, a technician, or in rare cases a poll worker. The application guides the user through the paper loading flow. For additional instructions, see the [printer-management.md](../vxscan/printer-management.md "mention") article in the user manual.

When the scanner is not in use between elections, the thermal paper roll should be left loaded in the scanner to protect the thermal printer head.

### Other Maintenance Tasks

VotingWorks recommends cleaning the screen and USB ports as needed. The screen can be cleaned by gently wiping with cleaning wipes such as ULINE S-12236 or equivalent. The USB ports can be cleaned by blowing them with air in a can, such as ULINE S-6771 or equivalent, from a distance of at least one foot. Read all manufacturer safety instructions before using air in a can.

## Software Maintenance

There are no required steps for maintaining the software or firmware itself. The software is installed by VotingWorks and cannot be modified. The underlying databases for all applications are self-maintaining and do not need to be tuned by end users.

## Data Maintenance

As VxScan is used for an election, it will gradually be storing more and more ballot data. As long as users remain within the specified [System Limits](https://app.gitbook.com/s/Z4bC0rbmogHEUUuMLAUa/system-performance-and-specifications/system-limits "mention") they should not get remotely close to data limits on VxScan. The free disk space available on is visible to system administrators and election managers under the **Diagnostics** menu accessible from the application sidebar when authenticated.

When the machine is unconfigured or ballot data is cleared, disk space will be recovered. It will likely not return all the way to 100% free disk space, due to how the database is configured to vacuum only as needed, but all disk space from deleted records will be usable for new records.

VotingWorks recommends that all cast vote records are backed up to a USB drive before being cleared from the application. As ballots are scanned, cast vote records are automatically backed up to the attached USB drive. If an additional backup is required, an election manager can separately save CVRs.

## Maintenance Support & Spare Recommendations

VotingWorks recommends having scanner cleaning supplies immediately available at all times. If streaking is detected in the scanned images, the scanner will have to be cleaned to continue scanning. In order to avoid delays in voting, scanning cleaning supplies should be at all voting locations.

VotingWorks recommends having extra thermal paper rolls easily available at all times. If thermal paper runs out, the polls cannot be opened or closed until paper is reloaded. Pre-election testing typically prevents paper issues, but it may still occur when election managers do not load new rolls for each election. Extra thermal paper rolls should either be available at every voting location or transportable to voting locations within a reasonable time window.
