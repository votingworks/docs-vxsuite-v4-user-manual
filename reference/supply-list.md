* 28# Bond (105 GSM)
* 32# Bond (120 GSM)
* 100# Text (140 GSM)&#x20;
* 40# Bond (150 GSM)&#x20;
* 90# Index (162 GSM)

### Marking Utensils

There is no specific recommendation for a marking utensil but it should be an ink pen that dries quickly. No markers.

### Seal & Port Blocker Requirements

The VxScan, ballot box, and VxAdmin and VxCentralScan cases should be secured with tamper evident numbered pull-tight seals like this: [https://www.cambridgeseals.com/heavy-duty-pull-tight-seal](https://www.cambridgeseals.com/heavy-duty-pull-tight-seal)\
