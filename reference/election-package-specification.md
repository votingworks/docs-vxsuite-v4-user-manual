# Election Package Specification

VxAdmin is configured with an election package (see [configure-vxadmin.md](../central-system-setup/configure-vxadmin.md "mention")), which specifies the details of the election as well as various settings for the system. This page documents the format of the election package.

## Overview

An election package is a ZIP file containing a number of JSON files:

* **election.json** - The election definition (contests, ballot styles, etc.)
* **systemSettings.json** - Settings for the various machines
* **metadata.json** - Documents the election package version

There may also be a few other files present that are not used in v3.1:

* **appStrings.json, vxElectionStrings.json** - Translations of voter-facing content
* **audioClips.jsonl, audioIds.json** - Audio recordings of voter-facing content

## Election Definition (election.json)

The election definition utilizes a customized version of the NIST Ballot Definition Common Data Format (CDF), which is specified here:&#x20;

* PDF: [https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1500-20](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.1500-20)
* Web-friendly UML: [https://github.com/usnistgov/BallotDefinition/blob/master/BallotDefinition\_UML\_Model\_Documentation.md](https://github.com/usnistgov/BallotDefinition/blob/master/BallotDefinition\_UML\_Model\_Documentation.md)

The VotingWorks election definition format (vxCDF) modifies NIST CDF in a few ways:

* It uses only a subset of the objects and fields defined in NIST CDF
* It extends the format with some additional fields to support data that is not included in NIST CDF

For documentation of the fields used in vxCDF, refer to the schema: [https://github.com/votingworks/vxsuite/blob/v3.1.0-release-branch/libs/types/src/cdf/ballot-definition/vx-schema.json](https://github.com/votingworks/vxsuite/blob/v3.1.0-release-branch/libs/types/src/cdf/ballot-definition/vx-schema.json).

## System Settings (systemSettings.json)

The system settings uses a custom JSON format to define additional settings for the machines.

The system settings file uses the follow schema:

```json

  "properties": {
