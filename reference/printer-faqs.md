### HP Printer FAQ

**Do we need to install toner?**

New printers come with toner installed by default. The display will alert you when the toner level becomes low, at which point please follow [HP's instructions](https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c06392751) to replace it.

**The printer displays "Select Language" and won't print. What do I do?**

Configure the printer by responding to the on-screen prompts. You can simply press the "OK" button repeatedly, selecting all the defaults, until it says "Ready."

**How do I fix streaks, lines, or otherwise poor print quality?**

Print a "Cleaning Page." Navigate through the following options on the printer LCD screen:

1. Setup
2. Printer Maintenance
3. Print Quality Tools
4. Cleaning Page

Printing the cleaning page will usually clear the printer's rollers of stray ink that is causing print issues.&#x20;

**What if printing a "Cleaning Page" helps, but the issue keeps coming back?**

It's possible the paper you are using is not compatible with the printer. When toner doesn't print properly to a page, it can end up on the rollers where it will cause streaks on later pages. Try printing another cleaning page and verify you are using the [recommended paper](printer-faqs.md#recommended-and-compatible-paper).

If you are using a recommended paper, the toner cartridge may be defective and may need to be replaced.
