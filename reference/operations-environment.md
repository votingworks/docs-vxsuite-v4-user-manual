# Operations Environment

The voting equipment, when stored in cases, is resistant to light dust and small water splashes, but should not be exposed to heavy dust or rain without additional protection.

Additional environmental protection requirements:

* Only open and use indoors; do not use outdoors.
* Use only on stable horizontal surfaces, not on inclines or moving surfaces.
* Do not use in hot ambient temperatures greater than 95F, near open flames, or near other heat sources.
* Do not use in cold ambient temperatures less than 50F, or near snow and ice.
* Do not use near sources of liquid spray, precipitation, smoke, or construction dust.
* Keep out of direct sunlight during operation.

Additional electrical service and auxiliary power requirements:

* As possible, operate the VxScan and VxMark systems plugged into UPS power.
* Disconnect all power and wait at least 30 seconds before any electrical servicing.
* Only trained technicians should perform any electrical service on systems that requires opening up external panels.
