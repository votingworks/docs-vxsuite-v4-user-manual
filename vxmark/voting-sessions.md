# Voting Sessions

### Activating a Voting Session

{% hint style="warning" %}
A voter may bring their own Personal Assistive Technology (PAT) device (ex. jelly bean switch, sip and puff device, etc.) or headphones. It must have a 3.5mm plug or connector. Once plugged in, a test screen will pop up to assist in configuration.  See [System Administrator Functions & System Diagnostics ](system-administrator-functions-and-system-diagnostics.md)for instructions.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

If a voter chooses to use the VxMark, you'll need to use your Poll Worker Card to select their ballot.&#x20;

* [ ] insert Poll Worker Card
* [ ] select the voter's precinct
* [ ] select the voter's ballot style

{% hint style="warning" %}
If the wrong ballot style or precinct was selected, insert the Poll Worker Card (if not already inserted) and select _`Deactivate Voting Session`_ to return to the selection menu.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Marking a Ballot

Let the voter know they can begin voting by selecting _`Start Voting`_.

One contest will display at a time. The voter will select the candidate(s) of their choice. The voter moves to the next contest by selecting _`Next`_. The voter can skip a contest by selecting _`Next`_ without making a selection.  To return to a previous contest, select _`Back`_.  A _`More`_ button will display if there are more candidates or text than fit on a single screen.&#x20;

{% endhint %}

### Entering a Write-In

To enter a write-in candidate, select _`add write-in candidate`_ and use the keyboard to type in the candidate's name. Select _`Accept`_ when finished.&#x20;

### Reviewing Votes

After working through all contests, a Review Your Votes screen appears that allows the voter to change any vote by selecting _`Change`_. Once selections have been reviewed, select _`Print My Ballot`_. The ballot will print and be displayed for review. The final Review Your Votes screen is displayed to compare the official ballot selections with the screen. Select _`My Ballot is Correct`_ to cast the ballot.&#x20;

</div>

{% hint style="warning" %}
If the voter removes the ballot from the printer to review, the VxMark will ask if they are still voting. They should reload their ballot to cast the ballot. If the ballot is not reloaded, the VxMark will clear the ballot after five minutes of inactivity.
{% endhint %}

The screen will show the ballot being cast and verify it was cast and dropped into the ballot bin.&#x20;
