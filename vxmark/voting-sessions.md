Once plugged in, a test screen will pop up after the device is plugged in to assist in configuration.  See [System Administrator Functions & System Diagnostics ](system-administrator-functions-and-system-diagnostics.md)for instructions.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

If a voter chooses to use the VxMark, you'll need to use your Poll Worker Card to select their ballot.&#x20;

### Marking a Ballot

A _`More`_ button will display if there are more candidates or text that fit on a single screen.&#x20;
