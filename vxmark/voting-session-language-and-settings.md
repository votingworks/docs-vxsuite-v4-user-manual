### Settings

#### Text and Screen Color

Four different color options are available for users. While we provide a short description of who may benefit most from these different options, please note that the user likely knows what setting is best for their disability.&#x20;

**White text, black background** - used by a person that finds white backgrounds too bright due to visual disabilities. May also be easier to read when room lighting causes a glare on the screen.

**Gray text, dark background** - used by a person needing lower contrast. For example, a person with dyslexia may find the screen quieter.

**Dark text, light background** - as the default this setting will be used by most people.

**Black text, white background** - used by people who need the highest contrast because of light vision or color perception disabilities or aging.

#### Audio

Audio is always defaulted to on when headphones are plugged in. Select _`Mute Audio`_ to mute all sound.  Select _`Enable Audio-Only Mode`_ to hide the screen. Voters using only audio to navigate through the ballot may want to hide the screen for privacy. Additionally, a voter who has a T-coil neckloop may unplug the headphones and plug that device into the headphone jack.&#x20;
