# VxMark Diagnostics

In preparation for an election or in response to issues, the diagnostics interface can help verify VxMark is functioning as expected or pinpoint problems that do arise. Both election managers and system administrators can access the diagnostic interface.

The diagnostics screen shows information about how the machine is configured, how much storage is left on the device, and the current status of the hardware. There are tests for the accessible controller, front headphone input, PAT device input, and printer-scanner

For each component test, simply select _`Test xxx`_ and follow the instructions on the screen. The results of the most recent test are displayed on the diagnostics screen.
