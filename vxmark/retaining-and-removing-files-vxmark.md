# Retaining and Removing Files - VxMark

### VxMark Log Files

VxMark does not retain any type of ballot or voter data. The only file to retain is the Log file. Machine log files are saved in the /logs folder on the USB drive. To save the log file, insert a USB drive, then insert an Election Manager Card, and select _`Save Log File`_.

To remove the election definition from VxMark, select _`Unconfigure Machine`_. And then confirm by selecting _`Yes, Delete Election Data`_.&#x20;
