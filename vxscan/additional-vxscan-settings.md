# Additional VxScan Settings

## Saving CVRs

The cast vote records contain the images and the interpretation for each ballot cast and is used to tally votes in VxAdmin. The cast vote record saves continuously to the USB drive throughout the day and again at the close of polls.  If another copy is needed, however, it can also be saved by selecting _`CVRs and Logs`_ from the side menu and selecting _`Save CVRs`_.

The _`Pause Continuous CVR Export`_ feature is used to disable continuous cast vote record export in the case that a USB drive fails or is unavailable. When continuous export is paused, VxScan can be used without an inserted USB drive and CVRs must be manually exported from the election manager menu after polls are closed. If you experience USB drive issues, contact customer support. This setting should only be used if advised by the VotingWorks support team.

## Saving Logs

The logs contain information about the regular operation of the hardware and software and also any error messages. Both election managers and system administrators can export logs by selecting _`Save Logs`_ .

## Setting Date & Time

The time on VxScan should stay mostly accurate, including automatically adjusting for daylight savings time, but can drift slightly over time. Both election managers and system administrators can update the time by selecting _`Set Date and Time`_.
