## Pause or Resume Voting

The _`Pause Voting`_ action in the poll worker screen is generally used by jurisdictions conducting early voting over multiple days or during an emergency situation. To pause voting and prevent ballots from being cast at VxScan:

* [ ] insert a poll worker card and select _`Menu`_
* [ ] select _`Pause Voting`_

One copy of the voting resumed report will print. If additional reports are needed, select _`Reprint Voting Resumed Report`_ to print more. The voting resumed report and the voting paused report should have the same ballots scanned count.
