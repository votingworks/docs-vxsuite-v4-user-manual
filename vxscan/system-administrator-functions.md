# System Administrator Functions

A few functions in VxScan are limited to System Administrators and only appear in a menu with use of a System Administrator Card.

**Reset Polls to Paused** - use the _`Reset Polls to Paused`_ function to reopen the polls. This function is most often used as a result of a poll worker error.

**Set Date & Time** - use _`Set Date & Time`_ to change the date and time.

**Reboot to BIOS** - this function is reserved for VotingWorks support staff to boot the machine into the BIOS setup screen for firmware configuration.

**Power Down** - select to turn off the VxScan.

**Unconfigure Machine** - select _`Unconfigure Machine`_ to delete all data and the election configuration.

**Save Log File** - select _`Save Log File`_ to save the full log of VxScan activity to the /logs folder on the inserted USB drive.
