# VxScan Diagnostics

The diagnostics interface is used to test hardware before or between elections and monitor the status of the machine. It is accessible from both the election manager and system administrator menus.

The VxScan diagnostics screen shows information about how the machine is configured, how much storage is left on the device, and the current status of the scanner and printer. You may _`Perform Test Scan`_ to test the scanner's image capture,  _`Print Test Page`_ to test the printer, or  _`Test Sound`_ to verify the speaker is working properly.
