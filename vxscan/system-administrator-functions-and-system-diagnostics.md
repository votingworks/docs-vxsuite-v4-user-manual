# System Administrator Functions & System Diagnostics

A few functions in VxScan are limited to System Administrators and only appear in a menu with use of a System Administrator Card.

**Reset Polls to Paused** - use the _`Reset Polls to Paused`_ function to reopen the polls. This function is most often used as a result of a poll worker error.

**Set Date & Time** - use _`Set Date & Time`_ to change the date and time.

**Reboot to BIOS** - this function is reserved for VotingWorks support staff to boot the machine into the BIOS setup screen for firmware configuration.

**Unconfigure Machine** - select _`Unconfigure Machine`_ to delete all data and the election configuration.

**Save Log File** - select _`Save Log File`_ to save the full log of VxScan activity to the /logs folder on the inserted USB drive.

**Hash Validation** - select _`Hash Validation`_ and navigate to check.voting.works on your phone and scan the QR code on the VxScan. The site will validate the QR code data and verify the software is the same as the certified version.

**Power Down** - select to turn off the VxScan.

### System Diagnostics

Use the _`System Diagnostics`_ button to troubleshoot VxScan components.  If the machine is configured, you'll find the election definition, precinct, and ballot styles listed. Storage indicates how how much disk space is available on VxScan.&#x20;

Use _`Load Paper`_ to change the paper roll (see [Election Manager Settings](election-manager-settings.md) for instructions). and _`Print Test Page`_ to print a test page with the printer.&#x20;

Use _`Test Sound`_ to verify the sound is working properly.
