## CVRs and Logs

**Save CVRs** - the VxScan Cast Vote Record (CVR) contains the images and the data for each ballot cast and is used to accumulate totals in VxAdmin. This file saves continuously to the USB drive throughout the day and again at the close of polls.  However, if that fails or another copy is needed, it can also be saved by selecting CVRs and Logs from the side menu and selecting _`Save CVRs`_.

**Save Log File** - the VxScan Log file includes the system logs.

## System Settings

**Disable Double Sheet Detection -** use to disable the ultrasonic sensor on VxScan in the event it fails and improperly rejects single sheets as multiple sheets. If VxScan stops taking ballots or repeatedly displays the Ballot Not Counted - Multiple Sheets detected error message, contact customer support. This system setting should only be used if advised by VotingWorks support team.

**Calibrate Double Sheet Detection** - use to calibrate the ultrasonic sensor on VxScan before each election. Using two sheets of blank paper that is the same weight as your ballots, select _`Calibrate Double Sheet Detection`_ and insert sheets as directed on screen.&#x20;

**Set Time & Date** - use to change the system date and time. The time is automatically updated for Daylight Savings Time.  Select _`Set Date and Time`_ to change.

**Mute Sounds** - use _`Mute Sounds`_ to mute the VxScan system sounds.

**Hash Validation** - select _`Hash Validation`_ and navigate to check.voting.works on your phone and scan the QR code on the VxScan. The site will validate the QR code data and verify the software is the same as the certified version.
