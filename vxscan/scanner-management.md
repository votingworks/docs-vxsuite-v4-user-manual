# Scanner Management

VotingWorks recommends that someone cleans the scanner and calibrates double sheet detection before every election.

## Double Sheet Detection

{% hint style="info" %}
Double sheet detection is managed by election managers.
{% endhint %}

In order to prevent voters attempting to scan two ballots at once, VxScan has a double sheet detection feature. To manage double sheet detection, navigate to the **Scanner** tab of the election manager menu.

Tap _`Calibrate Double Sheet Detection`_ to begin calibration. Follow the instructions on screen. You will need two sheets of blank paper that have the same paper weight as the ballots for the election.&#x20;

The _`Disable Double Sheet Detection`_ feature is used to disable the ultrasonic sensor in the event that it fails and improperly rejects single sheets as multiple sheets. If VxScan stops taking ballots or repeatedly displays the _Ballot Not Counted - Multiple sheets detected_ error message, contact customer support. This setting should only be used if advised by the VotingWorks support team.

## Scanner Cleaning

The scanner must be clean to accurately detect marks on ballots. In order clean the scanner:

* [ ] open the poll worker door
* [ ] open the access door
* [ ] open the scanner

Once the scanner is open, you can use cleaning fluid and a microfiber or lint-free cloth to clean the scanner. Dampen the cloth and rub with moderate force on the scanning glass and the rollers:

* [ ] clean upper glass
* [ ] clean lower glass
* [ ] clean upper rollers
* [ ] clean lower rollers

After cleaning, you can close up the scanner again:

* [ ] close scanner
* [ ] close access door
* [ ] close poll worker door

To confirm the scanner is clean and producing clear images, you may either run the [scanner diagnostic](vxscan-diagnostics.md) or simply start scanning - if streaks are detected in the images, the software will alert the user.
