When you are ready to certify election results, you can mark VxAdmin results as official to print official reports.&#x20;

Make sure that you've imported all CVR files, completed all adjudication, and added all manual tallies before proceeding.

To mark results as official, select _`Reports`_ from the side menu and select _`Mark Election Results as Official`._

If you become aware of a mistake after marking results as official (say, you forgot to import one machine's CVRs), you can revert the results to unofficial as a system administrator. Log in as a system administrator and use the _`Revert Election Results to Unofficial`_ button.

Log out and log back in as an election manager to make the necessary edits and be sure to remark the results as official once done.
