{% hint style="warning" %}
The tally report will include any total write-in count of one or more in a contest. If a specific write-in candidate has enough votes to be considered in the outcome of a contest, the report will list that candidate and their vote total. The tally report will not list every write-in adjudicated - the write-in adjudication report will have the full list.
