{% hint style="warning" %}
The Tally Report will include any total write-in count of one or more in a contest. If a specific write-in candidate has enough votes to be considered in the outcome of a contest, the report will list that candidate and their vote total. The Tally Report will not list every write-in adjudicated, the Write-In Adjudication Report will have the full list.
