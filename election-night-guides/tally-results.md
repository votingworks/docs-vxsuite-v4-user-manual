## Tallying CVRs

All tabulation functionality in VxAdmin is available by selecting Tally from the side menu. Insert a USB drive and select _`Load CVRs`_ to load the Cast Vote Records.

To tally results, each USB drive from the precincts and VxCentralScan must be loaded. One at a time, insert the USB drive(s). A dialog box will pop up and show you each CVR file saved on the USB drive. Select _`Load`_ next to the file (official ballots, correct number of ballots, correct time) you'd like to load.

When loaded, confirm that the presented file name, CVR count, and precinct(s) are as expected. Load CVR files from all of your scanners, VxScan and VxCentralScan.&#x20;
