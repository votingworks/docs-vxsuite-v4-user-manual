# Loading CVRs

{% hint style="info" %}
The following steps must be completed by the election manager.
{% endhint %}

Navigate to the Tally screen by selecting Tally from the side menu. Select _`Load CVRs`_ to load the cast vote records.

One at a time, insert the USB drive(s) containing CVR exports from VxScan and VxCentralScan. A dialog box will pop up and show you all CVR exports on the USB drive. Select _`Load`_ next to the export (official ballots, correct number of ballots, correct time) you'd like to load.

After loading the CVR export, confirm that the timestamp, CVR count, and precinct(s) are as expected. Load CVR exports from all of your scanners, VxScan and VxCentralScan.&#x20;
