# Retaining & Removing Election Files

### Retaining Election Files

After certification of an election and before configuring a new election, all election files and data should be saved and election package removed from the previous election.

VotingWorks recommends retaining the following files after each election:

* [ ] VxAdmin results file
* [ ] VxAdmin tally reports
* [ ] VxAdmin log file
* [ ] VxScan CVRs
* [ ] VxScan log file
* [ ] VxCentralScan backup (if applicable - see [Retaining and Removing files - VxCS](../vxcentralscan/retaining-and-removing-files-vxcs.md))
* [ ] VxCentralScan log file (if applicable - see [Retaining and Removing files - VxCS](../vxcentralscan/retaining-and-removing-files-vxcs.md))
* [ ] VxMark log file (if applicable - see [Retaining and Removing Files - VxMark](../vxmark/retaining-and-removing-files-vxmark.md))

**Note**: Ballots should have been secured post-tabulation. Follow state guidelines to ensure proper retention.

**Log files** contain records of user interactions with the machine (e.g., election officials and poll workers unlocking the machine, voters casting ballots, etc.) as well as internal system information (e.g., the status of paper running through the scanner, errors, etc.). [A detailed description for each event in the log can be found in Github](https://github.com/votingworks/vxsuite/blob/main/libs/logging/VotingWorksLoggingDocumentation.md).
