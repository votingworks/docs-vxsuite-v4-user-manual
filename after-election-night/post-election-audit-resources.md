# Post-Election Audit Resources

VxAdmin generates files that may be used in most typical post-election audit processes.&#x20;

For a ballot polling Risk-Limiting Audit, no files are needed from the voting system.

For a traditional or batch comparison Risk-Limiting audit use the [Tally Report Builder](../election-night-guides/reports.md#tally-report-builder) instructions, selecting the correct filter based on the units (precinct, scanner, batch, etc.) you're auditing.

For a ballot comparison Risk-Limiting Audit, files needed will be available in a future software release.
