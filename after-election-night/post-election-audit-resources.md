# Post-Election Audit Resources

VxAdmin generates files that may be used in most typical post-election audit processes.&#x20;

For a ballot polling risk-limiting audit, no files are needed from the voting system.

For a traditional or batch comparison risk-limiting audit use the [Tally Report Builder](../election-night-guides/reports.md#tally-report-builder) instructions, selecting the correct filter based on the units (precinct, scanner, batch, etc.) you're auditing.

For a ballot comparison risk-limiting audit or an image audit, cast vote records (CVRs) and image files can be pulled from the VxCentralScan and VxScan(s). Full file exports from VxAdmin will be available in a future software release. An imprinter can also be attached to a VxCentralScan to print a unique identifier on ballots scanned and the unique identifier can be found in the CVR. This allows for easier ballot retrieval and matching between CVRs, images, and ballots.&#x20;
