Each piece of VotingWorks equipment provides diagnostic information related to each system.  VxCentralScan shows the following indicators:

* **Battery Level** - indicates the percent remaining on the laptop battery
* **Power Source** - indicates if the laptop is running on battery power or an external power supply
* **Disk Space** - indicates how much disk space is available on the laptop
* **Scanner Connection** - indicates if the scanner is properly connected to the laptop or not

Use _`Perform Test Scan`_ to scan a test ballot and check to see if the scanner is working properly.  Use _`Save Readiness Report`_ to save a Readiness Report that shows the status of the laptop and scanner at the time of saving.&#x20;

An example of the Readiness Report is below:
