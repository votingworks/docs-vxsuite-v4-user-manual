# VxCentralScan Hardware Setup

## Hardware Overview

**VxCentralScan** is a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) laptop pre-installed with VxCentralScan software that connects to a Ricoh scanner.

## Imprinting

Both the fi-8170 and the fi-7600 can be used with an optional imprinter, the fi-819PRB and the fi-760PRB respectively. See the user guides for the [fi-819PRB](https://github.com/votingworks/docs-vxsuite-v4/blob/main/hardware-assets/cots-documentation/central-system/ricoh-fi-8170/ricoh-fi-819prb-user-guide.pdf) and [fi-760PRB](https://github.com/votingworks/docs-vxsuite-v4/blob/main/hardware-assets/cots-documentation/central-system/ricoh-fi-7600/ricoh-fi-760prb-user-guide.pdf) for assembly instructions. The scanner should be off when attaching the imprinter. After the imprinter is attached, adjust the paper guides on the imprinter to match the paper width of each batch, which is 8.5" for hand marked paper ballots or 8" for machine marked paper ballots.&#x20;

After the imprinter is attached, adjust the paper guides on the imprinter to match the paper width of each batch, which is 8.5" for hand marked paper ballots or 8" for machine marked paper ballots. This adjustment is necessary to ensure that imprinting is done outside of the ballot marking area on each ballot.

## Scanner Maintenance

Clean the scanner before every election. The rollers should be replaced occasionally depending on scanning volume. Consult [vxadmin-and-vxcentralscan-maintenance-manual.md](../system-maintenance/vxadmin-and-vxcentralscan-maintenance-manual.md "mention") for instructions on cleaning and maintaining the Ricoh scanners.
