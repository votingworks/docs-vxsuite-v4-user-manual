# VxCentralScan Hardware Setup

## Imprinting

Both the fi-8170 and the fi-7600 can be used with an optional imprinter, the fi-819PRB and the fi-760PRB respectively. See the user guides for the [fi-819PRB](https://github.com/votingworks/docs-vxsuite-v4/blob/main/hardware-assets/cots-documentation/central-system/ricoh-fi-8170/ricoh-fi-819prb-user-guide.pdf) and [fi-760PRB](https://github.com/votingworks/docs-vxsuite-v4/blob/main/hardware-assets/cots-documentation/central-system/ricoh-fi-7600/ricoh-fi-760prb-user-guide.pdf) for assembly instructions. Note that the imprinter should not be attached while the scanner is already powered on.

## Scanner Maintenance

The scanner should be cleaned before every election. The rollers should be replaced occasionally depending on scanning volume. Consult [the maintenance manual](broken-reference) section about cleaning and maintaining the Ricoh scanners.
