# Configure VxCentralScan

{% hint style="info" %}
The following steps must be completed by the Election Manager.
{% endhint %}

Before you configure VxCentralScan, you must setup the machine. Follow the steps in the [VxCentralScan Hardware Setu](vxcentralscan-hardware-setup.md)p.

To configure **VxCentralScan**, you must do two things in **VxAdmin**:

1. [Save the election package](../vxadmin-system-setup/save-election-package.md) to a USB drive.
2. [Create an Election Manager Card](../vxadmin-system-setup/programming-cards.md).

## Load Election Package

Once the election package is saved to a USB drive, you can load the file to VxCentralScan.

[Setup the VxCentralScan hardware](vxcentralscan-hardware-setup.md) and turn on the VxCentralScan laptop. Insert an Election Manager Card to configure VxCentralScan will be displayed.
