# Seal Recommendations

### VxAdmin & VxCentralScan

While in storage, the VxAdmin should be stored in its case with seals through each of the eyelets to the right and left of the carrying handle on the case. These will be removed and tracked when the case is opened for use and new ones should be applied and tracked when packed up for storage.&#x20;

### VxScan

**In Storage:** The scanner should be sealed with seals through each of the eyelets to the right and left of the carrying handle on the case.

**During Voting:** A seal should be placed through the hole in the security bolt to keep the poll worker door closed and the scanner latched to the ballot box.&#x20;

**During Voting:** A seal should be placed through the hasp in the auxiliary bin door when it is not in use.

**During Voting:** A seal should be placed through the hasp in the front ballot door.
