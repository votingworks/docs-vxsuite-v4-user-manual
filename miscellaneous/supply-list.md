# Supply List

The specifications and supply lists below define all the materials to run an election in addition to the machines and smart cards.

## Ballots

Ballots must be printed according to [paper ballot specifications](https://docs.voting.works/vxsuite-tdp-v4/system-performance-and-specifications/paper-ballot-specifications).

### Marking Utensils

The marking utensil for hand marked ballots should be a black or blue ink pen that dries quickly. Never use markers or highlighters.

## USB Drives

VotingWorks recommends the 64GB SanDisk Ultra Flair USB 3.0 drive (SDCZ73-064G-G46) as a cost-effective general purpose USB drive, but any USB drive meeting the specifications below can be used.

| Attribute  | Requirement                              |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Protocol   | 3.0 minimum                              |
| Capacity   | 64GB minimum                             |
| Length     | 55mm maximum, measured from inserted tip |
| Read Speed | 60 Mbps minimum                          |

A faster drive may be necessary when exporting large volumes of ballots from VxCentralScan, for which the 128GB SanDisk Extreme PRO USB 3.2 drive (SDCZ880-128G-G46) is recommended.

VotingWorks recommends using a new USB drive for each election and each voting device as well as separate USBs for L\&A testing.

## Seals

Cases should be secured with single use tamper evident numbered seals, such as heavy-duty [pull-tight seals](https://www.cambridgeseals.com/heavy-duty-pull-tight-seal). You may use different seals as preferred by your jurisdiction and may choose to use different types of seals, or even locks, if you confirm they fit through the seal points and properly secure the seal point. Locks shackles must be less than 5mm (3/16") in size to fit in all seal points.

## Scanner Cleaning Supplies

The scanners for VxScan, VxCentralScan, and VxMarkScan can be cleaned with scanner-specific cleaning fluid, such as Ricoh Cleaner F1 (PA03950-0352) or isopropyl alcohol with a concentration of 70% or higher. The fluid should be applied to a microfiber or lint-free cloth. The recommended cleaning SKU can clean a scanner 100 times.
