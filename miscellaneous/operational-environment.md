# Operational Environment

## Equipment Storage

The voting equipment, when stored in cases, is resistant to light dust and small water splashes, but should not be exposed to heavy dust or rain without additional protection.

## Environment Protection Requirements

* Only open and use indoors; do not use outdoors.
* Use only on stable horizontal surfaces, not on inclines or moving surfaces.
* Do not use in hot ambient temperatures greater than 95F, near open flames, or near other heat sources.
* Do not use in cold ambient temperatures less than 50F, or near snow or ice.
* Do not use near sources of liquid spray, precipitation, smoke, or construction dust.
* Keep out of direct sunlight during operation.

## Auxiliary Power Requirements

As possible, operate VxScan, VxMark, and VxCentralScan with power from a UPS battery backup power in case of power outages.

## Electrical Service Requirements&#x20;

* If electrical service is required, the end user should contact VotingWorks instead of attempting any electrical service.
* Only trained technicians should perform any electrical service on systems that require opening up external panels.
* Disconnect all power and wait at least 30 seconds before any electrical servicing.

## Equipment Transportation

When transporting equipment make sure all latches and straps are secured. And secure the containers in a manner where they will not move in transport. \
