# Configure VxAdmin

{% hint style="info" %}
The following steps must be completed by the System Administrator.
{% endhint %}

For each election, you will configure VxAdmin by loading an election package. VxAdmin is generally compatible with state election file data or a file format provided by VotingWorks. State specific instructions are provided separately.

## Load Election Files

When VxAdmin is not configured, the screen will prompt you to **insert a** **USB containing an election package.**

After inserting the USB drive, VxAdmin will automatically list the election package(s) available. Select the File Name of the correct election package to configure VxAdmin.&#x20;

If the file is not automatically listed, select _`Select Other File...`_ and manually select the file from the USB drive.&#x20;
