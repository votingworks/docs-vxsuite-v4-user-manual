Before using a USB drive, whether it's brand new or has been used in a previous election, it should be formatted.

Confirm you want to format the USB drive by selecting _`Format USB Drive`_. **Formatting the USB drive will delete all files on the USB drive.**

VxAdmin will then confirm your USB drive is ready for use.  Repeat this step for all other USB drives.
