* **Disk Space** - indicates how much disk space is available on the laptop
* **Printer**
  * &#x20;**Sleep Mode** - indicates if the printer is in sleep mode or not, press any button on the printer to wake it
  * **Toner Level** - indicates the amount of toner detected in the connected printer
  * **Test Print** - indicates if the printer has had a successful print or not

Use _`Print Test Page`_ to print a test page and verify the connected printer is working properly.  The Readiness Report can be used as a record of system diagnostic verification.  Select _`Save Readiness Report`_ to save a copy to a USB drive.&#x20;
