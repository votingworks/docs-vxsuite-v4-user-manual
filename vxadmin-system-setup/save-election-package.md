## Save Election Package

To configure VxScan, VxCentralScan, and VxMark you must first save the election package from VxAdmin to a USB drive. Select Election from the side menu in VxAdmin and select _`Save Election Package.`_

You will be prompted to insert a USB drive. Once you insert a USB drive, the screen updates and prompts you to save the election package. Select _`Save`_.

VxAdmin will generate the election package of all ballot styles, saving it automatically on the USB drive. The file is saved inside the /election-packages folder.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This election package is different from the election package used to configure your VxAdmin.
{% endhint %}

Once the file is saved, VxAdmin prompts you to eject the USB drive. Select _`Eject USB`_.

After a few seconds, VxAdmin will confirm USB ejection and then it is safe to remove the USB drive.
