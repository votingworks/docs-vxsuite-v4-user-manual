# Save Election Package

To configure VxScan, VxCentralScan, and VxMarkScan you must first save the election package from VxAdmin to a USB drive. Select _`Election`_ from the side menu in VxAdmin and select _`Save Election Package`_.

If you don't already have a USB drive inserted, insert a USB drive. Then select _`Save`_ to save the election package.

VxAdmin will save an election package to the USB drive. Once the file is saved, select _`Eject USB`_. VxAdmin will confirm once it is safe to remove the USB drive.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The election package saved at VxAdmin is different from the election package used to configure your VxAdmin. VxMarkScan, VxScan, and VxCentralScan can only be configured with election packages saved at VxAdmin.
