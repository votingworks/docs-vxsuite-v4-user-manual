| Streak Detected - The last scanned ballot was not tabulated because the scanner needs to be cleaned.                                 | Clean the scanner before continuing to scan ballots.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Official Ballot - The last scanned ballot was not tabulated because it is an official ballot but the scanner is in test ballot mode. | Toggle the machine mode under settings to match your ballots.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Test Ballot - The last scanned ballot was not tabulated because it is a test ballot but the scanner is in official ballot mode.      | Toggle the machine mode under settings to match your ballots.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Wrong Election - The last scanned ballot was not tabulated because it does not match the election this scanner is configured for.    | Locate the correct ballots or reconfigure your VxCentralScan with the correct election.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Unreadable - The last scanned ballot was not tabulated because there was a problem reading the ballot.                               | Try scanning again. If the ballot still fails to scan, and you are confident that the ballot matches the scanner configuration, the ballot may have print issues or other artifacts that are preventing it from being scanned, e.g., smudges on the QR code. Consider manually tallying it. |
