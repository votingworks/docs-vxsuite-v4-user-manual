| Wrong Election - The last scanned ballot was not tabulated because it does not match the election this scanner is configured for.    | Locate the correct ballots or reconfigure your VxCentralScan with the correct election.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | <p>eventId: scan-adjudication-info<br>adjudicationTypes: InvalidBallotHashPage</p>     |
| Unreadable - The last scanned ballot was not tabulated because there was a problem reading the ballot.                               | Try scanning again. If the ballot still fails to scan, and you are confident that the ballot matches the scanner configuration, the ballot may have print issues or other artifacts that are preventing it from being scanned, e.g., smudges on the QR code. Consider manually tallying it. | <p>eventId: scan-adjudication-info<br>adjudicationTypes: UnreadablePage</p>            |
