{% hint style="warning" %}
If these checks are not completed prior to election day, there's a risk that the system will not work properly. Keeping devices charged ensures the system will function during a power outage. Verifying consumables ensures the system can print on demand and save CVRs as required. Cleaning and calibrating ensures proper ballot scanning. Verifying the devices are free from damage and are in good working order ensures the equipment will function on election day. And verifying seal points ensures the system has not been tampered with.&#x20;

### Equipment Transportation

When transporting equipment make sure all latches and straps are secured. And secure the containers in a manner where they will not move in transport. \
\
Do not stack the units.
