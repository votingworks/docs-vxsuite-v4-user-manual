{% hint style="warning" %}
A USB drive is required to use VxScan on election day. After testing, you may reinsert the USB drive tested or a new USB drive into the USB slot and seal the machine until a poll worker accesses the machine on election day. If Official Ballot Mode was used, we recommend using a new USB drive for election day.&#x20;
