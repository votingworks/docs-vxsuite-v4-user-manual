### Toggle VxScan to Official Ballot Mode

If you used test ballot mode to conduct your L\&A be sure to put VxScan into official ballot mode. Insert the election manager card into VxScan and select _`Official Ballot Mode`_.

Remove the election manager card and confirm that the VxScan is in official ballot mode by checking that there is no orange _Test Ballot Mode_ banner, _Polls Closed_ is displayed, and the _Sheets Scanned_ count is 0.

{% hint style="warning" %}
A USB drive is required to use VxScan on election day. After testing, you may re-insert the USB drive used during testing or a new USB drive into the USB port and seal the machine until a poll worker accesses it on election day. If official ballot mode was used, we strongly recommend using a new USB drive for election day.&#x20;
